                <p>Hello!</p>
                <p>Before IMD, I did 3 years Graphic Design at AC and worked for a few years before returning to school.
                    This might explain my prior knowledge on web design.</p>
                <p>I remember hearing you talking with a student in class about returning to school later in life is
                    better and that mid-20s is ideal to start undergrad study and I really wanted to join the
                    conversation right there because that I couln't agree more. I feel like choosing IMD this time
                    around was a right move and I'm glad I got time to think through my decision. Somehow that also
                    validated me because sometimes I can't help but feeling like a walking fossil amongst the 18, 19
                    year old fresh out of highschool classmates &#128121;&#129344;</p>
