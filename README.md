# It's-a me Khoi!

## Reflections

This was fun. I went ultra maximalistic and experimental with this one, and I stayed straight away from the "make this look like a portfolio site - must be professional!!!" route. The way I interpreted this assignment was if I were a website, what would I look like. And here we are.

Overall, super fun experience. I like how crisp SVGs make the background images look. Working on some of the animations also refreshed my memory on how to do it and, more than that, have fun. I chose the patterns that look design-y and give off the vibe of optical illusions. Very neo-memphis and maximalistic.

If I had time, I would definitely make this website even more fun and interactive. Like a minigame with catching my head or some fun easter eggs somewhere. This might involve some advanced Javascript and would be a learning opportunity for me.

Things I did in terms of accessibility (although visually this site fails AODA compliance a lot - I made this site form over function on purpose but still I value an enjoyable, mostly stress free experience):

- All images are compressed hi-res, around 250 kb each, with lazy loading
- Text size is readable, using a [typographic hierarchy scale](https://typescale.com/)
- All links have proper hitbox and cursor state
- Overall not media-heavy making pages load relatively fast
